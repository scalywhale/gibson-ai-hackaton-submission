Capture all product documentation and key decisions in Readme.md file.
When UI decisions, data base decisions or prompt engineering decisions are needed, user your best judgement.

Use Gibson MCP for backend deployments and data schema design.

Use Streamlit for UI.

Always perform tests.

Donâ€™t ask the user, make all decisions yourself, automate the setup process. The user should get a running application as a result.
